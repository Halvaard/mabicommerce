## Why Ducats per second? (Or, "why not total profit?")

A common fallacy of many traders is to simply take the highest item they can to the place where it has the best profit. However, this fails to take the distance into account. Often, it is more efficient to take several loads that earn you less, but are faster to complete.

For example, in the time it takes you to run a trade from Dunbarton to Tara, you could have run several trades from Dunbatron to Tir Chonaill. The latter might net you less profit-per-trade than the former, but you can do *more* of them, leading to a greater net profit.

Ducats per second is the metric that accounts for this.

## Does MabiCommerce use hacks/mods/cheats?

No. MabiCommerce in no way modifies your game. Mabinogi is not even required to be installed to use MabiCommerce, although this certainly helps!

AutoDetection with Morrighan is purely a passive activity - no network data is modified by MabiCommerce.

You could, in fact, use a program like Excel to duplicate MabiCommerce's functionality, but I don't even want to think about the complexity of such a spreadsheet.

## MabiCommerce directed me to a town with a NEGATIVE profit! Who do I sue?
As players buy and sell goods to posts, the profits naturally fluctuate. It could be (especially with slower transportation, like the backpack) that by the time you get to your destination, the profit is now negative. There is nothing to do but turn to another trading post.

**Make sure you check the profits are positive before selling your goods!**

## MabiCommerce never directs me to Belvast. Is something wrong?
No. Unfortunately for Belvast, its distance from Uladh makes it horribly inefficient. MabiCommerce will certainly direct you there if it is viable, but this is extremely rare.

## I found a bug in MabiCommerce!
Please open a new [issue](/../../issues), containing details of the bug, screenshots if applicable, and the values you used. I can't reproduce a buggy trade without knowing the values used to calculate it!

## Do I have to use AutoDetect (Morrighan)?
No. You can always enter the information by hand.

## Morrighan causes my client to freeze (Or another client problem).
You need to report this issue on the Morrighan thread. It's also worth checking for and downloading a new version while you're at it.
